# chatty-search
## a bot for finding ten things to buy on eBay based on certain criteria

The bot starts by asking what you want to find, then continues through the conversation flow until it has all the necessary search parameters: search_term, condition, location_pref, budget and zip_code.

Once it has all the necessary information, it submits your search_term keywords to the getSearchKeywordsRecommendation endpoint to see if there are cleaner values for your keywords. For example, if you type "bickyle" as a search term, the API will suggest "bicycle".

After that it uses the criteria you set to find new or used items either nearby or available for shipping. Items are also constrained by your budget.

Item details and photos will be displayed next to the chat window with links to the item page on eBay.


# notes

I was originally going to use [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) for this project but couldn't get it to deploy correctly on Google cloud which is a requirement for Dialogflow functions. I spent about six days trying to get it to work. 

Only last night did I decide to use wit.ai and React so this project is the result of 24 consecutive hours of work.

# suggested behavior flow

Bot: Hello! What would you like to search for today?
